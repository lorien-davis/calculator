# Calculator Web App
A simple web calculator that is responsive and can compute basic math.

## Features
So far the calculator only supports very basic sums, like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

## Bugs
Currently the calculator is riddled with bugs, including but not limited to:
- performing operations when user has not input a number
- overflowing the screen when user makes a large calculation
- crashing when the user divides by 0

## How to use?

## Credits
I built this while following [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)'s curriculumn, as the final project of the [Web Development 101](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/calculator).

Bits and pieces of the code that helped build this project were stolen from [How to build a Simple Calculator App with Javascript](https://freshman.tech/calculator/).

For the UI I recreated [Patri Pascual](https://dribbble.com/patpascual)'s shot of a simple calculator UI.
