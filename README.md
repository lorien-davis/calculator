# Calculator Web App
A simple web calculator that is responsive and can compute basic math.

## Features
So far the calculator only supports very basic sums, like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

#### Coming Soon:
* Order of operations **_Including the use of brackets_**
* More complex operations *i.e cos, sin, tan*
* A delete button that only removes the last input

## How to use?

## Credits
I built this while following [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)'s curriculumn, as the final project of the [Web Development 101](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/calculator).

Bits and pieces of the code that helped build this project were stolen from [How to build a Simple Calculator App with Javascript](https://freshman.tech/calculator/).

For the UI I recreated [Patri Pascual](https://dribbble.com/patpascual)'s shot of a simple calculator UI.
